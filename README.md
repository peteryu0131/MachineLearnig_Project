# MachineLearnig_Project

In my Machine Learning Project, I utilized advanced machine learning techniques to predict refined oil prices based on historical crude oil prices. This project involved detailed analysis and preprocessing of data collected from various publicly accessible databases, using libraries such as Seaborn for data visualization and exploration. The predictive models created for this project, including Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor, showcased a significant positive correlation between crude and refined oil prices. My work specifically identified Linear Regression as the most accurate model for forecasting all types of refined oil, including gasoline, diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel. The findings provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the oil industry, potentially contributing to more strategic planning and decision-making. Future endeavours may enhance model parameters, explore additional influential factors, and integrate more sophisticated machine-learning techniques.!
